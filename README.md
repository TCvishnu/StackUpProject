# Project Name
Presenting our contact management system. Upon registration, users can conveniently store an unlimited number of contacts, including names, emails, and phone numbers. Editing and deleting contacts are seamless processes. The search functionality allows users to quickly locate contacts, and adding new contacts is hassle-free. For enhanced security, users must log in with their details and answer two security questions to verify their identity, ensuring access even if they forget their password. This system proves highly beneficial for organizing contacts, thanks to its user-friendly interface that simplifies the user experience.

## How it Works ?
1. To create an account, users need to register, and their information is stored in the backend.
2. Upon logging in, users are directed to a page displaying all the contacts they have saved.
3. Adding contacts is possible by selecting the "Add Contacts" button.
4. Deleting contacts is facilitated by clicking the adjacent "Delete" button next to the contact to be removed.
5. Contact editing is achievable by selecting the "Edit" button next to the specific contact.
6. Editing and deleting involve sending the index of the contact to the backend, where the corresponding data is removed from the database. For edits, the backend is updated with the new contact details.
7. When adding contacts, the details are appended to the backend data, which is then sorted and transmitted back to the frontend.
8. Users can log out, returning them to the login/registration page.
